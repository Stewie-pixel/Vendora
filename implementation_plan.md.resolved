# Implementation Plan - Vendora Multi-Agent System

## Goal Description
Build a multi-agent system ("Vendora") where agents collaborate like a department to solve complex user problems. The system will integrate with the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to allow agents to utilize external tools and resources securely and standardly.

## User Review Required
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Proposed Tech Stack**: 
> - **Backend**: Python 3.12+ with FastAPI. Python is chosen for its robust ecosystem of AI/Agent libraries (LangGraph, PydanticAI, or similar).
> - **Frontend**: React (Vite) + TailwindCSS for a modern, responsive, and aesthetic user interface.
> - **Communication**: WebSocket or HTTP REST for real-time agent feedback.
> - **MCP Integration**: Using the official Python MCP SDK to host/connect to MCP servers.

> [!NOTE]
> Please confirm if you prefer a different stack (e.g., full TypeScript/Node.js).

## Proposed Changes

### Project Structure (Monorepo approach)
- `/backend`: Python service hosting the agents and orchestrator.
- `/frontend`: React web application for the user interface.
- `/mcp-servers`: Directory for custom MCP servers if needed.

### Backend [Python]
#### [NEW] `backend/main.py`
- Entry point for the FastAPI server.
#### [NEW] `backend/agents/core.py`
- Base class for Agents using a standardized interface.
#### [NEW] `backend/orchestrator.py`
- Logic to route tasks to the appropriate "Department" or specific Agent.
#### [NEW] `backend/mcp_client.py`
- Wrapper to interact with MCP servers and expose tools to agents.

### Frontend [React/Vite]
#### [NEW] `frontend/src/App.tsx`
- Main application shell with "Department" view and "Chat" view.
#### [NEW] `frontend/src/components/AgentStatus.tsx`
- Visual indicator of which agent is working and what tools they are using.

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- Unit tests for Agent logic (mocking LLM responses).
- Integration tests for MCP tool calls.

### Manual Verification
- **Scenario 1**: User asks a complex question requiring research (Search Agent) and synthesis (Writer Agent).
- **Scenario 2**: Connect a local MCP server (e.g., FileSystem) and verify agents can read/write files as requested.
